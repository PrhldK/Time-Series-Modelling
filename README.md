# Time-Series-Modelling

This project aims at building a time series model to create an hourly forecast of temperature for a retail store. The Storeâ€™s analysts believe that extreme outdoor temperatures may affect the sales of the main retail store; They want a forecast of these temperatures to help them further evaluate this claim.
